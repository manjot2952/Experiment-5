# 🚀 React Router with Lazy Loading & Suspense

## 📌 Experiment Title
Implementation of React Router with Lazy Loading and Suspense.

---

## 🎯 Aim
To implement routing in React using React Router and optimize performance using Lazy Loading and Suspense.

---

## 📚 Objective
- To understand React Router.
- To implement multiple routes.
- To implement Lazy Loading using `React.lazy()`.
- To display fallback UI using `Suspense`.
- To improve application performance using code splitting.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- React JS
- React Router DOM
- JavaScript (ES6)
- CSS

---

## 📂 Project Structure

```
src
 ├── component
 │     ├── Home.jsx
 │     └── About.jsx
 ├── App.jsx
 ├── main.jsx
 └── App.css
```

---

## 🔹 Features Implemented

✔ Routing using React Router  
✔ Lazy Loading using `React.lazy()`  
✔ Suspense fallback loader  
✔ Code Splitting  
✔ Navigation between pages  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Components are loaded only when required.
- `React.lazy()` dynamically imports components.
- `Suspense` shows a loading message until component loads.
- Improves performance by reducing initial bundle size.

npm run dev
```

Then open:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Understood client-side routing in React.
- Learned code splitting using lazy loading.
- Implemented Suspense for fallback UI.
- Improved performance using dynamic imports.
- Gained practical knowledge of React application structure.

---

## ✅ Result

Successfully implemented React Router with Lazy Loading and Suspense.  
The application dynamically loads components and displays a fallback loader during component loading.
